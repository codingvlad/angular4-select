# angular4-select
A small repository holding a project example for demonstrating the use of a form group with a select input and two-way data binding attached to it. This version uses Angular 4.

# What you can find here
Not to many developers have created examples of form creation using Angular 4. Even more rare is to find a good example of a select input element with two way data binding attached to it in the context of a form. It is even harder to get an idiomatic use of these technologies. This repository provides one approach for doing just that.
